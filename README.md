Attend your classes and mark the polls hassle-free.

## Prerequisites

[Python3](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

[Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/intl/en_in/chrome/)

Install Selenium
```bash
pip install -U selenium
```

## Configuration

Change the ID and PASSWORD field to your login ID and Password.
Make sure they are correct. 
Incorrect password is not handled by script right now.

Download chrome web driver according to your chrome version from [here](https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads).
PATH is the path to your downloaded web driver

I suggest putting webdriver in a safe place ;)

```python
ID = 1181XXXX 
PASSWORD = 'Something@123'
PATH = "/home/blackhawk/tools/webdriver/chrome/chromedriver"
```

## Usage

Run it using this command.

```bash
python3 test.py
```
